                <p>
                    Abbeyfield Golden Bay Incorporated is a non-profit
                    organization dedicated to enhancing the lives of older
                    individuals by providing safe, supportive, and affordable
                    housing. We believe in fostering a sense of community and
                    independence for our residents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our house is more than just a building; it's a home where
                    residents can enjoy companionship, security, and a vibrant
                    social life. We are part of the wider Abbeyfield New Zealand

                <p>
                    Our mission is to alleviate loneliness and insecurity for
                    older people by providing them with their own private space
                    within a supportive, family-like environment. We aim to
                    offer a balance of privacy and companionship, with
                    home-cooked meals and a dedicated house manager ensuring a
                    comfortable and caring atmosphere.
